## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft rose (#E6A394) for a warm, approachable feel. This slightly muted pink offers a modern touch.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0), close in hue to the primary, for a clean, liquid glass (glassmorphism) style.
- Accent color: Pale cyan (#A3E6D5), an analogous color, is used to highlight interactive elements.
- Headline font: 'Belleza' (sans-serif), creating an elegant aesthetic that aligns to the app's focus on both business and visual appeal.
- Body font: 'Alegreya' (serif), paired with Belleza for good readability and clarity in extended text sections.
- Use minimalist, line-based icons that are relevant to each section (sales, inventory, etc.).
- Subtle transitions and animations on user interactions, such as adding a new sale or updating inventory.
